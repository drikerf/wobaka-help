# Track deals in your pipeline

Pipelines are a great way to track deals and opportunities. It's basically a kanban board, so if you're familar with that you'll feel right at home, if not, don't worry, just read along.

Wobaka allows you to have as many pipelines as you want and customize them to fit your needs. You can for example have pipelines for: Opportunities and Renewals or perhaps different pipelines for different teams or geographic areas.

This guide will show you how to get started with tracking opportunities.

### Create a new opportunity

You can create opportunities on contacts or on the pipeline page. Let's begin with the contact.

On the left side you can see the opportunities section. Just click _New_ and it will show you a little form. The form is prefilled with your _default opportunity settings_ which you can find in your company settings page.

Contacts can have multiple opportunities so it's easy to track initial deals, renewals, expansions and more.

You can also set the responsible user in your team for each opportunity.

### Create opportunities on pipeline page

The other way to create an opportunity is through the pipeline page. Start with clicking the _New opportunity_ button. This will take you to a simple form where you can also select contact for the new opportunity.
