### 2. Start automation

First you need to select which automation you want to send. You can see the details of all your automations under the "Automations" page. See the article [Automate your email outreach](automate-your-email-outreach.md) for more information about how to setup an automation.

If there're any errors at this stage, such as contacts missing a valid email address, we will inform you about what needs to be fixed before sending.

When you're ready, press "Start automation" ðŸš€.

### 3 \(Optional\) Customize

After starting an automation you always have 15 minutes to preview it by looking at the contact feed. This is also an opportunity to make further personalizations such as including a specific message.
