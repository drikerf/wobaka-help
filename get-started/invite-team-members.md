# Invite team members

You can invite as many team members as you'd like to Wobaka. It's super easy too!

### 1. Invite a new user

Head over to **Settings &gt; Users** and enter the email of the new user.

### What if the user already has a Wobaka account with the same email?

At this point a user may only have one Wobaka account per email.
