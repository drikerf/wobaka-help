# Email tracking

Email tracking is a powerful tool to analyze your email outreach performance and tweak your email subject and body to get better results.

Wobaka allows you to easily track both email opens and link clicks when sending email sequences. This guide will show you how to setup and use email tracking.

### Setup email tracking

You can easily setup email tracking when creating a new or editing and existing automation. Simply check each box depending on what tracking you want.

After enabling link tracking, all links created with the link tool in the email editor will be tracked. If you don't want to track a specific link, you can simply just type out the URL (which will be clickable in most email clients) instead of creating a link for it.

### Analyze performance

On the automation page you can see how many people have opened, clicked and replied to your emails. Now you can make insightful decisions such as working on your subject line if opens are low, or improve your messaging if clicks or replies are low etc.

### In the contact feed

You can see when contacts have last opened or clicked an email in the feed by looking for the ✉️ and ⚡️ icons on each message. Hovering over these icons will show you the exact time and date of the last action.

If there's been no action yet, but tracking is enabled, the icons will be gray instead.

### Changing tracking settings and running automations

When enabling email tracking it will not change any automations that have already been started. This allows you to toggle tracking for only the emails you want.
