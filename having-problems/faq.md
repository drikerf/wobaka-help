# FAQ

### What is this?

Imagine your favorite task manager. Now add email integration and contact pipelines to that. That's what we want Wobaka to be like. A simple, yet effective CRM system that will help you close more deals while being fun to use. If you're using Wobaka and missing follow-ups, We've failed.

### Why did you make Wobaka?

Being tired of countless of bloated CRM systems and missing follow-ups every day using spreadsheets we decided to do something about it. A CRM system that you'll actually enjoy using. We hope you'll like it.

### What's included in the price?

We don't like complex pricing. That's why Wobaka is all-inclusive. One plan. No add-ons or extra cost.

### Do we need to pay for each user?

No. We don't believe in per-user fees and unlike most CRM software we don't charge you per user. 2 users or 20, the price is the same. Imagine what that will add up to when you grow.

### Can we import our leads to Wobaka?

Yes! You can use our contact importer. If you need a tailored import, let us know and we'll be happy to help you out. Free of charge.

### Can we cancel any time?

Yes! Wobaka is a month-by-month subscription and you're free to cancel at any time. Just hit the cancel button on the billings page.

### How are payments processed?

We process your payment securely using Stripe. It's the same provider used by services like Slack, Lyft and Kickstarter. We do not store or handle your payment information directly.

### Can we add our signups to the CRM automatically?

Yes! With just a few lines of code you can add a new signup to Wobaka. Check out our docs for more info and examples.
