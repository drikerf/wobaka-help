# How to send better cold emails

Cold email and email in general works best when you don't try to cheat the system. We made automations so that you can offload time-consuming tasks like following up with a lead after some number of days. **Not to spam people.** Heck, it even took us a year before we added the ability to start automations in bulk.&#x20;

Here are some practical tips that you can use to improve your open, response and general success of your cold email campaigns.

### Keep it simple

Keep your emails as simple as possible. Less links, less styled text, less lists. Think plain text with some sprinkles. This way you emails are less likely to be classified as marketing campaigns or spam by Gmail, Fastmail and others.

Simple, plain emails are also much easier to read, especially on mobile.

### Don't attach files or images

Images and files make emails larger and this may trigger spam filters in Gmail, Fastmail and other providers. Keep your emails slim, add links to files instead and use something like Dropbox for hosting them.

People also don't appreciate their inbox being filled with megabytes of images, pdfs or whatever. Be nice ðŸ˜„.

### Why do I have to cancel automations manually?

Doing a full email integration, reading your emails and looking for replies doesn't make sense for many reasons. Mainly:

1. For privacy reasons, we don't think the trade off is justifiable. **Compared to other CRM and email software, we never have access to your emails**.
2. When someone replies to your email, you should probably update the contact in the CRM somehow anyway. Then it's easy to just click "replied" on the automation. For contacts that don't reply, you can easily let the automation finish and let your last step be a status change or archival of the contact.
3. We do not want to support spam behaviour. Don't send more cold emails than you can handle.

That's all folks! Good luck with your cold email and happy sending! ðŸ˜Š
